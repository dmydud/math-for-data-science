## Table of Contents
- [**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**](EDA): Covers various aspects of EDA, including data types, central tendency measures, variability estimates, statistical moments, and techniques for exploring data distributions and relationships between variables.

- [**Probability Distributions**](Probability-Distributions): Introduces fundamental probability distribution functions such as PMF, PDF, and CDF, along with specific distributions like binomial, Bernoulli, uniform, normal, and chi-squared distributions.

- [**Point Estimation**](Point-Estimation): Discusses point estimation, focusing on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation techniques for deriving point estimates from sample data.

- [**Interval Estimation**](Interval-Estimation): Covers the construction and interpretation of confidence intervals for population means and proportions, along with factors affecting interval estimation and practical examples.

- [**Hypothesis Testing**](Hypothesis-Testing): Introduces hypothesis testing and explores A/B testing, providing an overview of hypothesis testing procedures and practical examples in data science.
